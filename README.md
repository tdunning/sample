# Sample power data

This directory contains an example of power data (in the `data` directory) as well as code to use (log-synth)[https://github.com/tdunning/log-synth] to generate the machine inventory and power data (in the `synth` directory.

# Dependencies

The sample data itself has no dependencies. To generate new or additional data, you will need to install `log-synth` in a directory adjacent to this directory and have duckdb available. See the README in the `synth` directory for more information.
